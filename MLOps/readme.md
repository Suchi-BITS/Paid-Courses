## Overview
A complete hands-on curriculum to build scalable, automated, and production-grade ML systems with experiment tracking, model serving, monitoring, CI/CD and cloud-native deployment workflows.

---

## Key Features
- Build automated ML pipelines
- Track and version datasets, models and experiments
- Deploy ML models to production using best practices
- Monitor model drift and automate retraining
- Work with cloud and modern MLOps tooling

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Construct real-world ML pipelines using Airflow & MLflow
- Serve ML models using BentoML, FastAPI & Triton
- Implement online and offline feature stores
- Deploy & scale models using Docker and Kubernetes
- Build continuous training & monitoring pipelines
